# üê≥ Inception - 42 Project

This project consists of setting up a **Docker-based infrastructure** composed of multiple containers, each running different services, and configured to work together as a full WordPress web server.

## üì¶ Project Overview

You'll build a multi-service system using **Docker Compose**, managing:

- **Nginx** with SSL
- **WordPress + PHP-FPM**  
- **MariaDB**  

Everything is containerized, reproducible, and isolated ‚Äî all from scratch.

## üèÅ How to start

Just type `make` / `make all`, and you will have a little display of how to set up and use some commands in order to easily manage the containers.
