# 🏗️ Inception - 42 Project

This project consists of setting up a **Docker-based infrastructure** composed of multiple containers, each running different services, and configured to work together as a full WordPress web server.

## 📦 Project Overview

You'll build and orchestrate a multi-service system using **Docker Compose**, managing:

- **Nginx** with SSL  
- **WordPress + PHP-FPM**  
- **MariaDB**  
- Optionally extended with Redis, Adminer, or more

Everything is containerized, reproducible, and isolated — all from scratch.
